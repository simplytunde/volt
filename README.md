  with collateral of 10K PHR

17.6M volt was produced for swapping. 500k were mined 1-200 blocks to bring that amount to 18.1M PHR, the amount needed for the swap.

_Unfortunately, the code was not properly forked on GitHub from the PIVX repository. This serves the same purpose. We forked from [PIVX-Project/PIVX](https://github.com/PIVX-Project/PIVX/)._
